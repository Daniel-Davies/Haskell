# Haskell 

A collection of projects from my university studies. 

- Visit Language Engineering for a haskell compiler of a made up language (imperative style, close to something like C)
- Visit any other repos for first year small haskell exercises

# Compiling

Use the standard GHC, no bells and whistles.
